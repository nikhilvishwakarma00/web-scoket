A WebSocket is a communication protocol that allows for real-time, two-way (bidirectional) data exchange between a web browser (client) and a server over a single,
persistent connection, unlike traditional HTTP's request-response model. 
This full-duplex connection stays open, enabling the server to push data to the client instantly without the client repeatedly asking, making it ideal for live chats, multiplayer games,
stock tickers, and collaborative tools that need low latency and continuous updates. 


$##How it works

*Handshake: A WebSocket connection starts with an HTTP request, but the server "upgrades" the connection to the WebSocket protocol.
*Persistent Connection: Once established, the TCP connection remains open, reducing overhead from re-establishing connections for every message.
*Bidirectional Flow: Both the client and server can send data at any time, allowing for true real-time interaction. 

*Key advantages over HTTP
 Lower Latency: Eliminates the delay of repeated HTTP requests.
 Efficiency: Less overhead because HTTP headers aren't sent with every message.
 Real-time: Perfect for applications needing instant data updates.
